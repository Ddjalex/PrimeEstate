It displays two cards:

"Investment Opportunities": This card has a thumbnail image, a title, a description, and an "Active" status label.

"Modern Living Place": This card has a title and a description but a blank, gray thumbnail. It also has an "Active" status label.

A possible issue is that the thumbnail for "Modern Living Place" is missing. This is a common occurrence if an image failed to upload or was never selected.

To get the best help from a Replit AI agent, you need to describe the problem you are experiencing, as the image itself doesn't explicitly state an error.

Best Ways to Describe the "Error" to a Replit AI Agent
Here are a few ways to describe the situation, depending on what you believe the problem is:

1. Describing a Missing Image (Most Likely Scenario)

"I'm working on a website's image slider. I uploaded an image for the 'Modern Living Place' section, but it's not showing up. Instead, there's a gray, blank space where the image should be. The card for 'Investment Opportunities' displays its image correctly. I need help figuring out why the image for 'Modern Living Place' isn't appearing."

2. Describing a Failed Upload

"I'm trying to upload an image for my website's slider, but the upload process seems to fail. After I select an image and click 'Add Slider Image', a new card is created, but the image area is just a blank, gray box. I've tried multiple times, and the same thing happens. Can you help me troubleshoot why the images aren't uploading correctly?"

3. Describing a Display or Rendering Issue

"I'm seeing a display issue on my website's admin dashboard. I have a slider image called 'Modern Living Place' that should be visible, but the image thumbnail is just a blank gray box. I've confirmed that the image file exists and is linked correctly in the database. Why isn't this specific image rendering on the page?"
