"Fix the Hero Slider Management file upload functionality in the admin dashboard - uploaded images are not displaying properly in the slider management interface"

Key Issues to Address:
File Upload Component Integration:

The FileUpload component in the Hero Slider Management section is not properly handling image uploads
Images uploaded through the file upload interface are not being saved or displayed in the slider management grid
The file upload process may not be correctly linking uploaded images to the slider database records
Image Display and Preview Issues:

Uploaded slider images are not showing proper previews in the management interface
The image grid/cards are not reflecting newly uploaded images
Image URLs from uploads may not be properly formatted or accessible
State Management Problems:

The slider form state may not be properly updating when images are uploaded
The FileUpload component's onUploadComplete callback might not be correctly updating the slider image URL
Form submission may not be properly including the uploaded image data
API Integration Issues:

The slider image creation/update API calls may not be properly handling the uploaded image URLs
File upload endpoint for slider images might not be working correctly
Database operations for slider images may not be persisting the uploaded image URLs
UI State Synchronization:

The slider images list may not be refreshing after successful uploads
Query invalidation after slider image operations may not be working properly
Loading states during image upload and form submission may not be properly managed
File Path and URL Resolution:

Uploaded image paths may not be correctly resolved for display in the admin interface
Static file serving for uploaded slider images may have path resolution issues
Image URL construction for uploaded files may be incorrect
This issue appears to be a combination of frontend state management, file upload handling, and API integration problems that prevent uploaded slider images from being properly saved, displayed, and managed in the admin dashboard.
